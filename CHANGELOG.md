# Changelog

Notable changes to the mishmesh on-device UI. Versions are the mishmesh (mm)
version; each firmware also reports the meshcore (mc) base it was built on.

The release workflow reads the section matching the tag (`mishmesh-v<version>`)
into the GitHub Release notes, so keep the newest version at the top and start
its heading with `## v<version>`.
